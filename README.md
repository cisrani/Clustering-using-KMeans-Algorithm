# Clustering-using-KMeans-Algorithm
This repositories is implementing project from Data Science Workshop Second Edition Book by Packt

1st project : This project is implementing clustering using K-Means Algorithm Using dataset of Australian Taxation Office. The dataset contains statistics about each postcode (also known as a zip code, which is an identification code used for sorting mail by area) in Australia during the financial year of 2014-15. The main objective is to find groups (or clusters) of postcodes sharing similar patterns in terms of tax received and money deducted.
