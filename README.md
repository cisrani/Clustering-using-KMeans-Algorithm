# Clustering-using-KMeans-Algorithm
I have finished excercise from Data Science Workshop Second Edition Book by Packt about implementing Clustering using K-Means Algorithm 

#1st Exercise ("Clustering K-Means Data Science Workshop"):
In this exercise  is implementing clustering using K-Means Algorithm Using dataset of Australian Taxation Office. The dataset contains statistics about each postcode (also known as a zip code, which is an identification code used for sorting mail by area) in Australia during the financial year of 2014-15. The main objective is to find groups (or clusters) of postcodes sharing similar patterns in terms of tax received and money deducted.

#2nd Exercise ("Clustering Australian Postcodes By Business Income and Expenses"): In this exercise perform clustering analysis with k-means and visualize its results based on postcode values sorted by business income and expenses

#3rd Exercise ("Finding K-Values in K-Means Algorithm) In this exercise is perform clustering with k means by finding the best k-values using Elbow Method
